Collective cell migration plays a crucial role in diverse biological processes, including embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. In vivo systems, including the Drosophila egg chamber, Zebrafish posterior lateral line migration, and Xenopus neural crest cell migration, have facilitated the study of migratory cell behavior, revealing the core mechanisms of collective cell migration. Currently, only a few model systems allow the high-resolution genetic dissection of the molecular mechanisms driving cell motility during tissue morphogenesis in real time. The Drosophila testis myotube migration system which enables the genetic investigation of various developmental and cell biological questions, including modes of filopodia-based protrusion and locomotion, cell-cell adhesion, cytoskeletal mechanisms of collective decision-making, and collective closure processes. Hence, using the Drosophila testis myotube migration system as a model allows for high-resolution live-cell imaging and in vivo/organ culture techniques. However, the identity of key regulators of collective cell migration remains elusive. 

Our team aims to identify key regulators of collective cell migration using the Drosophila testis myotube migration system. We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on isolated myotubes to identify candidate genes regulating collective cell migration. Now, we are conducting an RNA interference (RNAi) screen using a tissue-specific expression system to target these candidate genes within the developing Drosophila testis muscle. By analyzing adult testis phenotypes using confocal microscopy and live cell imaging, we are able to identify genes whose knockdown led to defects in adhesion and migration during development.  In my part of the screen, I have screened though 46RNAi lines corresponding to 25 candidate genes.  One interesting hit is the Adhesion G-Protein Coupled Receptor CIRL (dCirl), which is known to be required for mechanosensation in Drosophila.  Knockdown of dCirl leads to gaps in the musculature of the adult testis, suggesting a possible role in nascent myotube migration. In the future, we will use live imaging and other approaches to define the role of dCirl in collective cell migration.
